You look down to see what looks like a bony spike burrowed in the ground a few feet ahead of you. ");

Figuring you've been ambushed, you run to the other end to confront your invisible assailant in broad daylight. As soon as you're out, your opponent surges after you. At first glance it looks like a catgirl, however, the shape of her paws and ears hint at being more like a lion’s, ");

The comparison to a cat ends there, due to the pair of large leathery wings that rest on her back.  Where you would have expected a cat tail a scorpion-like chitin covered tail grows. It ends in a bulbous tip crowned with sharp bony spikes, ");
