		/*Fight -Z
		 Marae's offshoot, [monster] stands rooted in front of you.  Solid black eyes with golden pupils stare out at you.  Her normally-nude body is concealed inside her tree, though occasionally she will flash you the devilish grin of a sadistic temptress and the bark will split to reveal a pale, jiggling bit of flesh.  A pair of gnarled oak horns sprout from her forehead; leaves and flowers alternately bloom and wither on them as her face contorts with emotion.

		 stats:
		 -hella endurance, int, and str
		 -lots o' lust resist
		 -lots o' hp
		 -good armor and regenerates hp/lust every round; but much less so of all three if Jojo is burning her shit
		 -rooted in place, so med-low spd; however, if PC fails a run check he is automatically constricted
		 -not for pussies; this fight should be almost unwinnable without Jojo unless you are wicked lucky or have a super-sploity build
		 -basically requires luck plus any of firebreath level grindan, stun abuse, or blood mage whitefire/arouse abuse
