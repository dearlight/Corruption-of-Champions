She asks the Champion to father her child; if that is impossible, but desired (or the PC doesn’t want to be the daddy, but wants Hel to have kids anyway), she will offer to get Mai the Foxgirl to knock her up instead; if it is undesired at all, the PC can ask Hel to go on herbs, suppressing her fertility until the PC's ready.
