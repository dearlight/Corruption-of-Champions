You keep quiet as he whimpers. Eventually, he stops, and you put your hand on his face. \n\n");

For the first time, his crooked smile is straight, and he looks unblinking into your eyes. \"What do you want of me, Champion?\" \n\n");

Struck with a playful idea, you push off with the rest of your tentacles, wrapping them quickly around his remaining limbs. Charybdis gasps as you immobilise him and rob him of balance, forcing him down onto the bed. He begins to laugh, but you lever yourself on top of him and kiss his full lips, your (breasts) bouncing off of his burly chest with every lunge of your face. You wrap a tendril around his slick member as it hardens, and he lies back on the bed. One of his tentacles runs along the crack of your ass, but he waits for you to make the first move.  \n\n");
		outputText("You lower yourself onto him, your lips parted ever so slightly by his tip. Struck by a mischievous thought, you lower yourself about an inch down, then back up, so slowly. After the first few times, he tries to rise, bucking his hips, but you see it coming, pulling yourself away.  \n\n"); 
		outputText("\"Ah ah\", you tease, putting a finger to his lips. \"When I’m ready\". You continue with the slow tease for another five minutes, but at the pleading look on his face, you decide to stop teasing him. You take a dollop of his pre with your tentacle, slathering your entrance. You lower yourself slowly onto him, gasping slightly as he parts your lips. He slides in smoothly, and as you revel in the feeling of being filled, he grins, twining his tentacles around each of yours. The added contact, the rubbing of smooth skin, feels wonderful, and as you open your mouth, he spins you around, gently pressing your back against the wall. He moves, your wet, tight channel clamping down on him. \n\n");
		outputText("Two of his tentacles wrap around you, one around your waist, one around your heads, cutting off your vision of everywhere except for him, his violet eyes right there, so close to yours as he kisses your cheek. His limbs are suddenly everywhere, one on each of your (breast description), pulling on your nipples, one hotdogging your (ass description), two more like warm, squishy bands around you, kneading your back and neck. You’re far less experienced than he is with your many limbs, but you try and return the favor, imitating his posture and pace, kneading the muscles and tracing his barrel-chest. \n\n"); 
		outputText("As you return the favor, his eyes smoulder, and he kisses you, first on the lips, then slowly, surely, he moves down to your neck. As he runs his lips along the soft front of your throat, you shudder, moaning slightly. It takes a few minutes for you to even realize that he’s stopped moving his cock inside your box, leaving it halfway in. You give him a kiss back, going in reverse, from his barrel-chest back up to his thick lips. As you kiss his lips, he leans in, pinning you against the wall, continuing his slow, sensuous pace, his head scraping every fold of your pussy, every limb in use as it caresses your entire body. Your nipples puff up, the areolae like nubs of iron. Your clit aches with all the tweaks and pressure. After about fifteen minutes of this slow, sensous torture, you can’t take it anymore. You slam your pelvis down as you push with your (arm description), pinning Charybdis down onto the bed as you pull back again.  \n\n"); 
		outputText("He quickly picks up the pace, and the multi pronged attack on your senses takes its’ toll. You howl, cumming hard onto his squirming cock-tendril. You slump, and he takes over, ravaging your box as fast as he can. You’re sensitive, and you try to communicate that, but all that escapes your mouth are the moans and howls of a bitch in heat, getting the dicking she didn’t even know she wanted. Your tentacles flail, some trapped underneath him as he pounds you from below. His cock twitches inside you, and you can feel the impending orgasm. You wrench, trying to get off this crazy, amazing ride before- \n\n"); 
		outputText("You feel the warmth flood you, your tentacles instinctively moving to your box, to fill it, to stop the flow, to stop him leaving you...But despite your instincts screaming at you, he doesn’t try to pull out. You collapse on top of Charybdis, both of you panting uncontrollably.  \n\n"); 
		outputText("\"Uh…\" You moan, trying to get words out, and he nods, your limbs entwined. \"Yeah…\" He falls asleep, and for the life of you, you can’t think of anything better to do right now.  \n\n");

He stands, butt naked, by the cutting board, and he turns around as you groan. \"Hey, are you okay?\" He asks, taking your hand as you sit up. \"I hope you at least enjoyed yourself.\" You rub your aching mons and grin ruefully, telling him that of course you did, otherwise you wouldn’t have gone off like that.  \n\n");
		outputText("\"Look...If you got pregnant…\" You blink. You hadn’t even thought of that! Before you can open your mouth, he puts a hand on your shoulder. \"I’ll come by your camp in a week or so. If you are, I’ll...Well...I’ll look after ya, okay?\" He hugs you, still naked, and rests his head on your shoulder. \n\n");
		outputText("\"You’ve got to go now, don’tcha?\" He asks. You nod, and he inhales, closing his eyes. \"Well, we gotta get back to shore, then. I’ll throw on my apron and get us back. Take what time you need to get...clean.\" He kisses you once more, a chaste kiss on the forehead, before doing exactly what he said, throwing on his smocklike garb and clambering back up to the deck. \n\n");
		outputText("You leave the cove, and you can feel his eyes following you. You turn back around, and he waves goodbye. \"Come back soon, [name]!\" You head back to camp, a smile on your face. \n\n");

He wriggles a little, clearly trying to let you have your fun, and you chuckle at his sensitivity. Rubbing a little bit of pre from your own throbbing member, you slather it along your length.

He smiles, before his tendrils wrap around your waist and shoulders, massaging your thighs, abs and shoulders. You groan at the feeling, pulling back before ramming your [cock] home again.  \n\n");

You realise the tendrils that he’s standing on are about to give out, and you wrestle his upper body down onto the bed. He comes first, soaking your nethers with his cum. The warm fluid and sudden smell pushes you over the edge, and you empty your balls with a roar, pulling your lover back against you, his body weight keeping you bottomed out inside him. His stomach bulges out a little before your cum begins to trickle out, and you pull out, exhausted. Between the two of you, you stagger back to his bed, plopping down exhausted next to each other.  \n\n");
