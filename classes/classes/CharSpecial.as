Now you are half-dragon, and while most changes are hidden inside your body, you still possess magnificent wings, imposing horns, incredibly long tongue and odd cock. Sharing common for kitsune tentacle obsession, you was unable to resist temptation, and now you have 3 tentacle cocks and venomous tentacle hair. Otherwise you body is mostly what you would expect from kitsune - cute, graceful and having capacity, straightforward impossible for your thin and small 4 foot frame.\n\nWith both religious and alchemical training you are skilled healer, able to treat wounds and poisonings alike. Your kitsune's trickster nature and pervert inclinations are making you susceptable to corruption, but at the same time your enlightment keeps you from really turning into demon, so corruption level does not really affect you much. Even with your willpower and religious training you sometimes struggle to restrain your impulse, and you always are ready for something very lewd. With your knowledge of healing and innatural body it is easy for you to enjoy things which would be really painful for others, and you are always ready to return favor. Still, you tend to care about mutual enjoyment - there are difference between extreme entertainment and torture, and you are mischievous, not evil. Natural gift, strong even by kitsune's measures and complimented by nine tails, granted you with very strong magic affinity, so you can cast spells not exhausting yourself even without enchanted robe, but despite strong magic affinity you wasn't actually much interested in combat magic before, so only can use fox fire as offensive spell.\n\nYour experiments left some strange effects within your body. Some are nice (you have unusually fast regeneration), some are strange (you can shift to incorporeality for a few seconds and even try to possess someone while in this state), and some brought more problems than benefits (insignificant improvement in magic power came with crippling penalty for your physical abilities).\n\nAlso, you are almost compulsive hoarder, so you developed ability to carry and store huge amount of things.\n\nNow you want to give your new body thorough test run, and portal to demon infested world looks appealing. No one said that common sense is one of your strong sides...\n\nTroublesome villagers near portal had strange demands about things which you can carry to other side, but you managed to conceal magic whip, so you wouldn't be unarmed, bud damned (literally) thing takes it's toll on user.\n\nYou still aren't really sure about your gender - having both sets doubles the fun, you still are a bit shy of your tentacles (that's main reason for your concealing clothes - your body is your doubtless masterpiece in all other parts), and being female in demon infested worlds tends to be a problem, so you decided to bring few transformative eggs, just in case.");
