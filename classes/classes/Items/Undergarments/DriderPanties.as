Brown-tinted bits of silk form the seams, looking for all the world like the twigs such a web would nestle between. Despite the translucent nature of the fabric, the flex of the material is clear, and each strand, while gentle on your fingers and assets, shows no sign of yielding to a blade. \n\nType: Undergarment (Lower)");
