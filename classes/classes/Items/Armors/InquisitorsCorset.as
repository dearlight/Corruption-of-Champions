Shrugging, you slide your arms into the sleeves, sticking your middle fingers through the extended ends.  Golden embroidery down their length contains some of the most ornate and stylized pictures of dicks you have ever seen, culminating in an excessive amount of gold thread splayed in your palm, symbolizing the ejaculate.  You lift your chin to fit the posture collar in place, completely hiding your neck from view as you lace it from behind.  The dark red works nicely with your " + game.player.skinTone + " " + game.player.skinDesc + ".   A small amount of delight fills you as you realize the collar is not as unforgiving as a true posture collar, allowing you a comfortable amount of movement - though you do briefly wonder what a fight would be like if it didn't.\n\n");

As you lace the corset up you realize that what you had taken for a stylized sword rising up between the cups bears a much greater resemblance to a prick.  Fair enough.  The belt practically attaches to the corset as though it were made to be a single article of clothing, clasping beneath a set of heavily stylized golden lines that you suspect are meant to be a face in the middle of either prayer or oral sex, or possibly both.\n\n");

It covers some skin to the right side, mostly in the back, but your front is on full display to the world.  The skirt feels as though it should go on a dancing showgirl rather than an inquisitor, but you made the choice you did and the results <i>are</i> arousing.  Golden trim takes on the form of waving and twisting tentacles as the bottom of the skirt gets closer, looking as though it wants to burst from the fabric and molest its wearer.\n\n");

The heel itself is hollow, to accommodate any natural spurs on the wearer's foot, and the rest of the boot seems surprisingly fitted to your dimensions.  To a certain extent it feels as though it is reshaping itself as you enter - parts that initially feel tight loosen up in minutes, as if the boots were breaking themselves in.  If what the note said is true, and the armor adapts to he who finds it, perhaps even hooves and paws could have fit, given enough magical power used in the creation.  Laces run up the side of each boot all the way to your thighs, resembling the corset they were paired with.  The front of them bear golden symbology, akin to the symbols  that sat on the front of the secret chamber.  Based on your previous decoding, they're halfway between a prayer and a exaltation of cock.  Standing up in them, you smile as your " + game.player.buttDescript() + " rises with their influence.");
