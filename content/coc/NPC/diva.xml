                <text name="first">
                    You are taking a walk through the mountain area when, much to your annoyance, a thunderstorm begins.
                    However unlike the ones you hear of back home... This thunderstorm has no rain.. peculiar.
                    Ever since you shut down the factory the weather has been erratic switching from clear to a full fledged thunderstorm randomly.
                    Deciding not to head back to camp yet, more out of spite than anything else, you seek shelter instead.
                    Your efforts are rewarded when you spot a large abandoned castle atop a particularly steep hill.
                    Thankfully, it’s not so steep as to require climbing, since the regular lightning bolt would have made that a rather dangerous task what with the risk of a rocky avalanche!
                    As is, you manage to make your way to the front gate without much effort, at least not when compared to some of the climbs you had to do on occasion while exploring this zone.
                    The aforementioned massive wooden doors opening to reveal a rather large vestibule, fitting for a castle this size, you guess.
                    Sadly, there’s no lighting.
                    While you were expecting as much, since the castle did look abandoned and thus has probably been looted down to the bedrock already, it’s still a bother.
                    At least the chances of demons being here has gone down considerably, since it’s unlikely one powerful enough to have gotten themselves night-vision worth a damn would stoop so low as to make their residence look abandoned just to get a cheap shot in.
                    Something else with night vision making this their home, however, still remains a distinct possibility. So either spiders or bats, probably.

                    The gate should make a good choke point, so you pick some debris as silently as you can and get back there, leaving it in a small pile by your side.
                    You unsheathe your weapons, square your shoulders and enter a combat-ready stance, that done, you pick from the little pile of debris whatever looks like it will make the most noise.
                    A metal scrap rusted beyond recognition will do nicely. Your pick made, you proceed to throw it as hard and far as you can into the castle’s depths, ready for anything to jump at you.
                    Nothing does jump out, which scratches out the possibility of anything feral living here, at least on this part of the castle.
                    Sadly, with all the noise the rain is making something could have been startled and, so long as it was far away enough, you wouldn’t have heard it, and since nothing charged at you, it means that if that’s the case it’s either an ambush or someone hiding.
                    With an annoyed sigh you move deeper into the castle, keeping an eye on your back and repeating the same tactic you used at the gate to check for possible traps or ambushes.
                    As you go deeper, you start noticing something moving on the edges of your peripheral vision every now and then, which coupled with the feeling of being watched makes you increasingly paranoid.
                    The fact that whatever or whoever it is makes no noise, or none that you can hear above the rain’s, doesn’t put you at ease, either.
                    You eventually find yourself in what you assume was used as a ball room.
                    As you move to the other end of it to check for anything worthwhile to loot (while you assume everything here has already been looted, you’ll be stuck here until the rain eases, so you might as well), when the door suddenly slams shut behind you, followed by the familiar click of a lock.
                    Between you and the door stands an odd woman, sporting a large leathery cape which covers her entire body.
                    What little you can see of her looks surprisingly human, with her pointy ears being the single exception, then again, you have seen more than one demon use capes like that to “flash” others with their assets, so what she has under her neck is anyone’s guess.
                    Her smile reveals a pair of sharp canines as she announces her intentions.

                    <i>
                        “Fufufufu… foolish mortal! Thou hast walked into mine trap! Abandon all hope of escaping mine castle unscathed, for I am Diva, grand Countess of Dusk!
                        <if test="silly()">You were expecting Dio, but it was I, Diva! </if>
                        Prepare to forfeit thine blood and body to me! TREMBLE BEFORE MINE POWER!”

                    </i>
                    She opens her cape, or rather, her pair of very large bat wings and makes what you assume she thinks is a dramatic leap, diving toward you.
                </text>
                <text name="second">
                    It doesn’t take long before a thunderstorm, yet again, begins.
                    If anyone had told you shutting down the factory would fuck up the weather this much, you would have had second thoughts before taking a wrench to that contol panel.
                    Granted, you would probably have done so anyways, that fucking hellhole deserved no less.
                    Anyhow, knowing the drill already, you march your ass back to Diva’s castle.
                    No sooner you enter that you can already feel movement on the edges of your peripheral vision.
                    Diva is already stalking you, it seems.
                    For one so arrogant and attention hungry, she sure is good at stealth.
                    However, as you expected, the power of drama compels her, so she won’t be showing up until you get somewhere suitable for a dramatic fight.
                    You steel your resolve and push down your exasperation as you decide to just bite the bullet and head to the ball room already, otherwise she will just keep staring at your back from shadowed corners like a lovestruck, socially awkward village girl for hours on end.
                    <if test="silly()">Huh, you might be onto something. Is this that “chuunibyou” thing the mechanic at the factory kept raving on about? He also said something about “Senpais” noticing things and some creature called “tsundere”.</if>

                    Just as you get inside, a triggering mechanism makes itself known, as the doors lock themselves with a click.
                    Huh, she got up to some tinkering between visits, it seems. Neat.
                    You might ask her about how she pulled off that automatic lock trick after you finish the fight <if test="$cabinBuilt">, would be nice to have in your cabin</if>.
                    Diva, unwitting of your musings, appears in a cloud of smoke at the center of the room.
                    She prepared some special effects, too. You would give a polite clap if you didn’t know she would bitch at you for breaking the mood.

                    <i>
                        “Fufufu... thine foolishness knows no bounds, coming yet again to try and defeat the almighty Countess of Dusk.
                        Dost thou not comprehend such thing is an exercise in futility?
                        No matter, I shall vanquish thee once again and take thy blood and body as mine, hero!
                        Prepare for thy demise!”

                    </i>
                    It takes all of your willpower to keep your palm from having an intimate reunion with it’s lover, your face.
                    Let’s get this over with before you accidentally sigh and hurt her feelings.

                </text>
                <text name="final">
                    This time you don’t even wait for a thunderstorm, you just head straight to Diva’s castle for another match.
                    Truth be told, you are beginning to get endeared to her, somewhat.
                    Also, you don’t begrudge having a good sparring partner, it’s nice having someone strong to practice against without any real risks should you lose.

                    Since there's no storm, Diva can’t really sneak around as easily, since there is no thunder to drown out the sound of her movement, so for once you will have to find her yourself.
                    It takes you about three seconds to guess that she will probably be cooped up in the highest tower of the castle.
                    The boarded windows are a bit of a give away, to be honest.
                    Now the question is whether she will be sleeping or waiting for you while sitting in the single gaudiest chair on the whole castle.
                    You eventually reach a room approaching whose gaudiness is nearing critical mass, everything is covered in red and gold, the drapes, the carpet, the coffin and even the fuckhuge throne Diva is sitting in.
                    Unsurprisingly, your guess was right.
                    What you didn’t expect, however is the deer-in-headlights look she is giving you.
                    In that very moment you decide that you are going to learn, or make from scratch if you must, a spell to turn memories into pictures, then fucking frame this moment in the gaudiest frame you find in the castle.

                    <i>“Aaaah...so the prey fancies itself a vampire hunter and dares come up to my very lair to slay me?! Thou shalt be found wanting for I will not go down easily! Prepare thyself, I shall not hold back this time!”</i>

                    And the drama queen fancies herself a dungeon boss, doesn’t she? Seems like either she just keeps away from the sun due to the power of drama compelling her or she is more powerful than you initially thought.

                    <i>“Enough! Cease this foolishness and surrender thine blood and body to me!”</i>

                    She, in what you assume she thinks is an elegant way, throws a glass cup filled with what’s probably blood to the ground as she takes flight, in as much as she can while indoors, high ceilings or not.
                    Aaaaaaand she has gotten herself a battle aura of darkness, of course she has.
                    <if test="silly()">Such is life in the zon- Mareth.</if>
                    But seriously, she is clearly stronger now.
                    Well, it seems she is not holding back this time around.

                    <i>“Wait, that wasn’t in the script! The hero was supposed to lose to the almighty vampire, be bitten, know love, marry, have children…no no no no and NO!”</i>

                    Is she for real... Does she really think this all was an elaborate play with her as the main character of some romance story?

                    She take on an annoyed expression then declares <i>“Cough cough... ahem..Oh how terrible, I the almighty queen of darkness lost to the hero what will happen of me will thy hero rape me and make me his bride by force or will I be left alone in this castle as he/she goes on for a new quest.“</i>
                    
                    Tired of her nonsense you decide to give her exactly what she asked for.
                    But the girl screams a spell that clearly doesn’t exist and disappears in a cloud of smoke from what is obviously a smoke bomb leaving one last warning.

                    <i>“I shall have my vengeance hero for I am the immortal invincible night terror Diva and believe me, I shall never be defeated again by the likes of thou!”</i>

                    It’s only when the smoke disappears that you notice a trap door under the carpet where she was standing.
                    When you try to open it you discover it’s locked.
                    You decide to head back to camp before the weird bat woman show up again.

                        You ask her why she's so keen on bringing a coffin with her anyway, can’t she just sleep in a bedroll like everyone else?

                        She works all night and by the time she's done dawn is about to break.

                        Once you are sitting on the bed,you two enjoy some idle chat before moving on as Diva close her wings around you in an almost possessive way and bites your neck.
                        Her bite is as pleasurable as ever and you feel at peace with letting her drink your blood.
                        You're not the only one aroused as the vampire clearly seems to also get off on this, looking reder by the second.

                        Her kiss is oddly pleasurable, like a warm bath after a rough day of work and you somehow feel at peace with letting the vampire drink on your blood.
                        You're not the only one aroused however as the pale woman cheeks redden and her eyes droop in a fawning deep love expression.
                        Diva break the embrace, her cheeks as red as the blood that she took, as her hand slowly moves downward.

                The both of you move in the darkness that night, looking for an easy meal.
                Not so surprisingly the mountain range is full of minotaurs and a sleeping minotaur is indeed the first thing the pair of you find.

                Truth be told the raging boner of his bull cock is enough of a tell for anyone to figure how he feels about having his blood sucked.

                Diva, considerate of your unwilling victim, give him a handjob to keep his pleasure growing while she keep sucking more and more of his blood the minotaur hips bucking the air mechanically as his dick escape his control.
                Soon the minotaur eye rolls and he falls unconscious.
                Whether it's from blood loss or from the consecutive orgasm the both of you have been forcefully inflicting on him is unknown.
                Diva and you break out from the embrace for a long coppery kiss, exchanging blood and saliva.

                <i>“Not the highest quality… I prefer yours [name]. Still the feast is better enjoyed with two then alone don’t you think?”</i>

                The both of you head back to camp, highly satiated, as the sun begins to rise again.
                Diva bids you good day as she head to her tent and coffin. As for yourself, you think your job is done when you walk at day so you skip sleep this time around.

                Not so surprisingly, your nightly vampiric meal offset this issue granting you the energy to go without rest this time around.

                    The both of you scream in ecstasy breaking out of the bite, blood still dripping from each other chin as you and Diva reach your orgasm.
                    Unsatisfied the both of you keep at it for several hours. After about the sixth orgasm...

                    You start to doze off tired as Diva pull you down in her coffin still embracing you.

                    You wake up in the morning, still hugging with Diva. She’s fast asleep but still wearing a content smile.

                Seriously why does she need blood to survive anyway. Couldn't she just eat a steak like everyone?

                <i>
                    “Thou may not know but my very fragile stomach does not allow any other form of nutrition.
                    I wouldn't be able to eat like the others even if I wanted to.”
                </i>

                So she literally get sick when eating normal food… well that's sad for her. What about garlic?

                <i>“Simple allergy, nothing more.”</i>

                Is her issue contagious?

                <i>
                    “Not unless you drink some of my blood or blood I drank from.
                    My bite is not viral but can leave my prey weak and some time close to death from blood loss.
                    Now if thou would excuse me I need to prepare for tonight.”
                </i>

                You nod and let the vampire to her thing going back to yours.

                So, something came to your attention… why exactly does she hate sunlight.

                <i>“It’s bad for my skin… also bright light just outright hurt my eyes. I’m almost blind at day and when I’m not I have to constantly cover my eyes to be able to see anything ahead of me.”</i>

                So it's not because she will turn to ashes or anything of the stories.

                <i>“If you’re talking about vampire tales from foreign lands I will have you know I’m alive just like you are. I just happen to have a body closer to bats and nocturnal creatures then I do to the daywalkers. As far as it goes the only trait I share with your so called mythical vampire is that whenever I drink a lot of blood I begin to develop magical powers and tremendous strength. I know for a fact I age at a slowed rate although I will likely still die when I get too old, I only have an extended lifespan rather than true immortality. Furthermore drinking heals my wounds quickers thanks to my ability to swiftly metabolise food to repair my damaged tissue.”</i>

                Well, now that you think of it, you wonder if meeting a vampire who has none of the standard weaknesses but the strength of a woman five time her size is any better then the monster of legends told of in Ingnam. You leave to ponder on this somewhat creepy question.

            <text name="her">
                Now that you think of it was she always a vampire?

                <i>“No...In the same way as most adventurers I used to be a human and came here by accident about 30 years ago. Truth be told Mareth was already a hell of a mess back then.”</i>

                So what happened anyway?

                <i>“The demons happened, some crazed freak with horns caught me while I was sleeping and brought me to his laboratory to experiment on me. Said something along the line of creating a new variety of demonic servant for Lethice and that he did as he toyed with my body for an entire month using both corruptive material and modified transformative items. Regardless, the incubus messed up badly because not only I awoke in a bloodcrazed rage, but I pretty much drank him dry along with his other test subjects. He had three orgasms by the time I was done and I was not going to hold back after being starved from food for an entire month.”</i>

                This explains the aphrodisiacs in her bite and her fleeting magical talents if not absurd strength. Well at least she didn’t get her vampirism out of nowhere.

                You ask Diva if she would mind giving you some blood.

                <if test="player.batScore() gt 6 or player.vampireScore() gt 6">
				She blush with embarrassment and reply <i>“Thy know thou could've just asked to drink straight from the tap I wouldn’t had minded. Perhaps another time.”</i>
				<else>
				<i>“I wouldn’t mind [name] but be warned that it is highly infectious.”</i>
				</else>
				</if>

                She hands to you a vial right away.
