                While wandering the trackless sands of the desert, you break the silent monotony with a loud 'thunk'.
                You look down and realize you're standing on the lid of an old chest, somehow intact and buried in the sand.
                Overcome with curiosity, you dig it out, only to discover that it's empty.
                It would make a nice addition to your campsite.

                You decide to bring it back to your campsite.

                While exploring the desert, you find the wreckage of a building.
                Judging from the debris, it's the remains of the library that was destroyed by the fire.

                You circle the wreckage for a good while and you can't seem to find anything to salvage.
                Until something shiny catches your eye.  There are exposed nails that look like they can be scavenged.

                You take your hammer out of your toolbox and you spend time extracting straight nails.
                Some of the nails you've pulled out are bent but some are incredibly in good condition.
                You could use these nails for construction.
